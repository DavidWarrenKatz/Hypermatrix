Name: Hypermatrix
Version: 0.1.0
Summary: Hypermatrix is a command-line tool for integrating multi-omics data and analyzing epigenetic data using advanced tensor techniques. It features commands like 'ABcluster' for single-cell clustering and A/B compartment analysis, and 'differentiate_chromosomes' for distinct A/B compartment calls across homologous chromosomes. Hypermatrix leverages Non-Negative Tensor Factorization (NTF) to preserve critical interaction information, offering a powerful solution for complex multi-omics integration and epigenetic analysis.
