    \textbf{Figure \thefigure.} This figure is an example of a 2 x 2 x 2 tensor of real numbers. The two frontal matrix slices are colored distinctly. There are relationships between the frontal slices and the horizontal slices (not colored) as well as relationships between the two-dimensional slices and the rows, columns, and pillars. Tensors should be treated as a single entity to preserve information encoded in these fundamental relationships.
